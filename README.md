# My Godot Game Project

Hello everyone,

This is a game I've been working on over the past **week**, and I'm excited to share it with you.

## About the Game

In this game, you guide a **knight** through various terrain-filled levels to reach the end of the map.  
Along the way, you'll encounter:
- **Slime enemies** that try to stop your progress
- **Coins** to collect and boost your score

More enemies are planned to be added soon, along with new and challenging maps — so stay tuned for updates!

## Game Engine

The game is built using the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/), a free and open-source game engine that’s perfect for beginners and professionals alike.  
Its simplicity and flexibility made it the ideal choice for this project.

## Features

- Developed entirely in **Godot**
- Knight-themed action and exploration
- Enemies (currently slimes) and collectible coins
- Beginner-friendly codebase and structure
- Future updates with new maps and enemy types

## Note

This is just the beginning. More exciting features are on the way!  
Feedback and suggestions are always welcome.
