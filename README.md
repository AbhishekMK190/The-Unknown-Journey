# My Godot Game Project

Hello everyone,

This is a game I've been working on for the past **week**, and I'm excited to share it with you.

## Game Engine

The game is built using the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/), a powerful and user-friendly open-source engine.  
It's a great choice for beginners who want to enter the game development field.

## Features

- Developed entirely in **Godot**
- Simple, fun, and interactive gameplay
- Clean and beginner-friendly code structure

## Note

This is just the initial version. More features and improvements will be added soon.  
Feedback is welcome and appreciated!
