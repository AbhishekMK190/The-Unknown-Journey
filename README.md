🎮 Welcome to My Game Project!
Hello everyone! 👋

This is a game I've been working on over the past week, and I'm super excited to share it with you!

Godot is a powerful and beginner-friendly open-source game engine that's perfect for anyone looking to step into the world of game development. I highly recommend it for aspiring developers due to its simplicity, flexibility, and active community.

🚀 Features
Developed entirely using Godot

Fun and interactive gameplay

Built with passion and a love for game development
